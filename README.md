Hi fellow LaunchBoxers! It's been almost 2 months since I've been working on my arcade theme for bartop and cabinet. Now I ported it from my head to BigBox I can finally release an alpha version. Most of it is a port of the Retropie Nevato theme mixed with my own additions. Massive thanks to @y2guru who built the Community Theme Creator and helped me a lot with it. This isn't an official release yet but more like a semi-public alpha build for testing and development. Theme will be open-source with released source code on my Github once I release the 1.0 version.
